Simple algorithms to generate some of de Bruijn objects - non-cyclic de Bruijn sequence (using greedy algorithm) and non-cyclic rotate resistant sequence (using backtracking algorithm). What was the purpose of implementing these algorithms? I used them to verify hypothesis that comes to mind after discussion of length of both types of de Bruijn sequences and describe results in my bachelor's thesis in mathematics.
